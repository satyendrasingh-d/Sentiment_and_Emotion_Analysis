The project focuses on preprocessing raw text data, extracting meaningful features, and building machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify emotions expressed in product reviews. The emotions may include happy, sad, angry, neutral, or positive/negative. The performance of these models is evaluated to determine the most effective approach for emotion prediction.\n","\n","# 📘 Explanation of the Objective (NLP-Based Emotion Analysis)\n","## 1. Use of Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n","\n","NLP enables machines to understand, interpret, and analyze human language. In this project, NLP techniques are used to convert unstructured textual reviews into structured data that can be processed by machine learning algorithms for emotion detection.\n","\n","## 2. Text Preprocessing Using NLP Techniques\n","\n","The text data is cleaned and normalized using standard NLP preprocessing steps, including:\n","\n","Tokenization\n","\n","Lowercasing\n","\n","Stopword removal\n","\n","Stemming or Lemmatization\n","\n","Removal of punctuation, special characters, and noise\n","\n","Feature extraction using Bag of Words (BoW) or TF-IDF\n","\n","These steps enhance text quality and improve model accuracy.\n","\n","## 3. Feature Extraction\n","\n","NLP-based feature extraction techniques transform text into numerical vectors that represent emotional patterns within the reviews, enabling machine learning models to learn and differentiate between emotions.\n","\n","## 4. Machine Learning Model Training\n","\n","The extracted features are used to train multiple machine learning classifiers, including:\n","\n","Multinomial Naive Bayes\n","\n","Each model learns to classify text into different emotion or sentiment categories.\n","\n","## 5. Model Evaluation\n","\n","The trained models are evaluated using performance metrics such as:\n","\n","Accuracy\n","\n","Precision\n","\n","Recall\n","\n","F1-score\n","\n","This evaluation helps identify the most effective NLP-based model for emotion analysis."],"metadata":{"id":"xeMbImkWvdrr"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# Importing
